Edit: I've made a new website! For some more information about me, please check out "t-vine.github.io". There's only a little on it, due to some personal problems currently. 


Hello, I'm T-Vine! I'm an amateur coder interested in several languages and increasing my general knowledge.
I'm especially interested in the realm of Mathematical or Computational Biology.

Thank you for reading this!

Things I'm planning/working on:
- ~Visualizing the Mandelbrot set and other fractals.~ Completed! Mandelbrot, Multibrot, Tricorn and the Julia set have all been modelled!
- ~An algorithm for creating Lagrange polynomials.~ Completed! While it struggles with decimals, it was really a proof of concept, and turned out really well!
- Visualizing Flow Fields.
- Machine Learning/AI
