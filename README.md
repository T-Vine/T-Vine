Hello, I'm T-Vine! I'm an amateur coder interested in several languages and increasing my general knowledge.
I am especially eager in the usage of coding to solve problems both big and small, especially with the use of mathematics. One such example that interests me is the use of AI within conservation and National Parks, in order to monitor species: biology and conservation is something I am exceedingly passionate about. I'm also very interested in research for worldwide problems such as cancer, and the usage of multiple disciplines to try and fight them.
Though at the moment I am only tinkering with projects in order to develop my skills, I hope to be able to collaborate with others to do such a thing one day. 

Thank you for reading this!

Recent Things I've Been Working On (not yet public):
- Visualizing the Mandelbrot set, and general research into complex numbers.
- Using AI to scrape large data sets, hopefully ones relating to healthcare to examine this.
- Visualizing Flow Fields
