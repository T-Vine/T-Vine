Hello, I'm T-Vine! I'm an amateur coder interested in several languages and increasing my general knowledge.
I am especially eager in the usage of coding to solve problems both big and small, especially with the use of mathematics. One such example that interests me is the use of AI within conservation and National Parks, in order to monitor species: biology and conservation is something I am exceedingly passionate about.
Though at the moment I am only tinkering with projects in order to develop my skills, I hope to be able to collaborate with others to do such a thing one day. 
While research is what interests me most, I want to be able to use that to make an impact on the world. 

Thank you for reading this!
