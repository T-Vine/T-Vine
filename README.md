Hello, I'm T-Vine, a passionate programmer and amateur mathematician. I have a strong love for the use of technology for good, and commonly code in Python, Javascript, the Wolfram Language or Rust.

Things I'm planning/working on:
- ~Visualizing the Mandelbrot set and other fractals.~ Completed! Mandelbrot, Multibrot, Tricorn and the Julia set have all been modelled!
- ~An algorithm for creating Lagrange polynomials.~ Completed! While it struggles with decimals, it was really a proof of concept, and turned out really well!
- Visualizing Flow Fields.
- Machine Learning/AI
